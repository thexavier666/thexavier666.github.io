      <description>Last night, I was installing Ubuntu Mate in a machine which already had Ubuntu installed in it. But this version was installed in LVM logical volumes. I still have to learn LVM but that is for another day. The issue that I was facing was that I could not delete those partition during installation. After some hopeless searching, I decided to use fdisk to delete them, and it worked!</description>
