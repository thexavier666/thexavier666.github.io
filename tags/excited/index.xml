I had some difficulty in understanding how to setup the custom themes. Then I had the brilliant idea of moving the theme.toml file to the Hugo directory and lo, the site was created properly!
This theme that I&amp;rsquo;m using is called Hyde-y, which is extremely clean, Material-designed, and hopefully responsive.</description>
