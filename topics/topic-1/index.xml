      <description>Installing Hugo is not a big deal. You just have to download the proper deb file from their site. But using it, is another issue. The main problem that I faced was using the themes. Every theme has a toml configuration file which is in charge of all the web elements (forgive me misusing the terms for I don&amp;rsquo;t web development too well). The problem is that theme makers use different toml files; some are feature-rich and some are barren.</description>

      <description>This is my first post in this site (Technically)
Since I am not the sharpest tool in the shed, I needed to try out Hugo for an entire afternoon to make it work properly.
I had some difficulty in understanding how to setup the custom themes. Then I had the brilliant idea of moving the theme.toml file to the Hugo directory and lo, the site was created properly!
This theme that I&amp;rsquo;m using is called Hyde-y, which is extremely clean, Material-designed, and hopefully responsive.</description>
