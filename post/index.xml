      <description>This is just a tutorial/guide for myself because I need to install and reinstall Linux quite a few times. Some of the tips are for laptops only. They will be tagged with [Laptop]. I generally install Ubuntu Mate in all machines because it&amp;rsquo;s light and stable.
Network connectivity Adding proxy Edit the file /etc/profile and add the following lines
export http_proxy=&amp;quot;http://10.3.100.207:8080&amp;quot; export https_proxy=&amp;quot;http://10.3.100.207:8080&amp;quot; export ftp_proxy=&amp;quot;http://10.3.100.207:8080&amp;quot; export no_proxy=&amp;quot;localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.0.0/8&amp;quot;  Enabling proxy for apt This is required for installing updates.</description>

      <description>Development in SDN can be an issue if you do not have access to proper hardware. Good SDN switches can cost upwards of 2000$ (Rs 1,50,000). An alternative to dedicated switches would be makeshift switches using standard PCs, with a few extra ports. Here is a tutorial showing how to convert a PC into an SDN switch.
Hardware needed to create a OpenFlow switch All of this should be available at a good computer hardware store.</description>

      <description>Installing Hugo is not a big deal. You just have to download the proper deb file from their site. But using it, is another issue. The main problem that I faced was using the themes. Every theme has a toml configuration file which is in charge of all the web elements (forgive me misusing the terms for I don&amp;rsquo;t web development too well). The problem is that theme makers use different toml files; some are feature-rich and some are barren.</description>

      <description>This is my first post in this site (Technically)
Since I am not the sharpest tool in the shed, I needed to try out Hugo for an entire afternoon to make it work properly.
I had some difficulty in understanding how to setup the custom themes. Then I had the brilliant idea of moving the theme.toml file to the Hugo directory and lo, the site was created properly!
This theme that I&amp;rsquo;m using is called Hyde-y, which is extremely clean, Material-designed, and hopefully responsive.</description>
